## Please Note

This assumes you have already created a slack app in your current workspace and added the appropriate permissions. For this app to work, you'll want to include the following scope(s): `users.profile:write`. If you don't know where to start, read the slack app documentation [here](https://api.slack.com/start/apps)!

**This app is currently only supported on macos as it uses applescript internally to get current track information**

## üì¶ Installation

This application is intended to be ran globally. If you have forked this repository and wish to contribute see [Local Development](#local-development) for instructions on how to run things locally.

**npm:**

```bash
npm install -g now-listening
```

## üèÉ Running the App

To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
now-listening
```

Upon running the app for the first time, you'll be prompted to provide your user token and preferred music provider. These credentials will be written to a file called `config.txt` in the dist directory. Subsequent runs will read those credentials from `config.txt`.

To find your user token go to https://api.slack.com/apps/. Select your app from the list. Then click `Add features and functionality`, followed by `Permissions` and copy the token in the box below `User OAuth Token` it will start with `xoxp-`. See more about user tokens [here](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types#user).

Currently **_Now Listening_** supports `Apple Music` and `Spotify` with plans to support other services in the near future.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

### Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
### Run the app in dev mode: 

To run the app, run the following script:
```bash
npm run dev 
```
This will start nodemon in watch mode and rebuild the app anytime you make changes. 

### Build the App

To build the app, run the following script:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will build the app with [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) and overwrite the existing `dist` directory with your changes.
