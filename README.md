**Please Note**

This assumes you have already created a slack app in your current workspace and added the appropriate permissions. For this app to work, you'll want to include the following scope(s): `users.profile:write`. If you don't know where to start, read the slack api documentation [here](https://api.slack.com/start/apps)!

🏃 the App:

- npm run start
